    "#### Binary option background\n",
    "Nadex binary options trade between 0 and 100 and pay off 0 if the underlying (the S&P 500 Future or one of several other US or global futures, currency exchange rates, or other indices) is at or below the strike price at expiration. They pay off 100 if the underlying is above the strike.  They trade weekly, daily, 2-hour and 20-minute durations.  To short the index, you sell an option.  There is no put option.  Selling at 30 actually costs 100-30 = \\\\$70 and gives you a short option with an inverted payoff.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you buy at 70 or sell at 30, you invest \\\\$71 either way. (\\\\$1 commission on all trades and settlements in the money, losing out of the money doesn't cost a fee).  If you sell (buy) to close that long (short) option at 60 (40), you lose \\\\$10 plus fees on both ends for -\\\\$12 net.  If the option finishes in the money you make (lose) 100-70-2 = \\\\$28  (30-100-1 = -\\\\$71).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because binary options always trade between 0 and 100, these instruments trade very differently from stocks or regular options.  We can count on the prices always to be in this range, so we can key on exact, repeatable option price values in ways one could not on a stock or the future or index underlying the binary option. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact binary options always behave in a fairly consistent and similar manner. Their time value decays much more quickly than standard options, because their durations are much shorter.  As the options move through the final half of their lifetimes, they are near 0 (under 20) if the underlying is a strike or two below the strike price and near 100 (above 80) if the UL is well above the strike price.  The option whose strike is nearest the underlying price remains somewhere near 50 until the last few minutes.  If the UL crosses its strike, then the option jumps up and down around 50.  A very risky situation indeed.  If the UL stays on one side or the other of the strike, then the binary option decays from the mid-range to 0 or 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Trading strategy development\n",
    "\n",
    "Will trade on the time decay of 20-minute options in the last 10 minutes before expiration.  May also collect data on the last half hour of 2-hour options.  Will buy at a point where partial decay gives a return at least as big as the partial loss exit point.  Will determine exact entry, profit exit and loss exit points based on frequency of outcomes in collected data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "That's approximately sell at 35, take profit at 10, cut loss at 50, or buy at 65, take profit at 90, cut loss at 50.  These entry and exit points yield a risk of \\\\$17 versus a reward of \\\\$23.  If we can do that with discipline (it's hard to catch an option at exactly 50 as they are most dynamic between 40 and 60), then a 50\\% probability of win is profitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set the entry and exit points (price, possibly with time range or path dependencies like hysteresis) for an expectation of profitability, I will collect data at the option level to determine approximate probabilities of late-term option finishing in or out of the money and of moving past the 50 mark.  Not going to get involved with full lifetime of the option, even 20-minute options, nor try to play the movement of the underlying index."
